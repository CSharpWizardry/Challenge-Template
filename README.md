# Challenge-Template
Template to the creation of challenges/Katas.  

The template is built using:
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)  
* [Sonar Lint](https://www.sonarlint.org/)
* [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/)
* [SpecFlow - Business Automated Tests on .NET](https://specflow.org/)

## Template Structure
The Template solution is composed of the following projects:
* __CSharpWizardry.Level.Challenges__: Students will develop their code on this project. Some boilerplate code is provided;
* __CSharpWizardry.Level.Challenges.Tests__: Tests that assert the student provided code against expected results;
* __CSharpWizardry.Level.Challenges.Solutions__: Possible solutions to the code challenges;
* __CSharpWizardry.Level.Challenges.Solution.Tests__: Tests that default solutions against expected results;
